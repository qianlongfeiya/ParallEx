# Parallex

## Summary

`ParallEx` is a group of common parallel collections. The intent is to make it easy to process large amounts of data. 

## Goals

1. Create immutable parallel collections for Elixir. 
2. Conform to the existing Enum protocol.
3. Vastly improve the performance over sequential collections.
4. Make the collections extensible.
5. Easy conversions between sequential and parallel counterparts.

The initial design of `ParallEx` is largely influenced by the design of Scala's parallel collections. `ParallEx` also references [A Generic Parallel Collection Framework by Aleksandar Prokopec, Tiark Rompf, Phil Bagwell, and Martin Odersky](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150220/files/pc.pdf)
